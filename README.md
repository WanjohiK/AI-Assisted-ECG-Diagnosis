## Project Overview
AI-Assisted-ECG-Diagnosis is a multimodal AI system that leverages both deep learning models and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to assist in the diagnosis of ECG signals. The system is designed to analyze ECG data for rhythm and ischemia detection, providing reliable and accurate results for cardiologists. The system is powered by a combination of advanced deep learning models and LLMs, aiming to integrate and reason like a cardiologist.

## Goal
The final goal is to create a comprehensive AI system capable of:
- Reasoning like a cardiologist using fine-tuned LLMs
- Detecting rhythm abnormalities and ischemia in ECG signals using deep learning models
- Integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for enhanced AI-assisted reasoning
- Developing an intuitive user interface to present diagnostic results effectively

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning**: Models for ECG rhythm and ischemia detection.
- **Fine-Tuned LLMs**: Models to reason like a cardiologist.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Integration for reasoning with external knowledge.
- **User Interface**: Designed to present results and assist in diagnosis.
- **Python Libraries**:
    - TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning models)
    - Hugging Face (Fine-tuning LLMs)
    - scikit-learn (Data Processing, Evaluation)
    - OpenCV/Streamlit (UI development)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Raw ECG data is preprocessed and labeled using cardiology-specific diagnostic guidelines.
2. **Deep Learning Models**: Trained models for rhythm and ischemia detection using advanced deep learning techniques.
3. **LLM Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuned large language models to mimic cardiologist reasoning for diagnostics.
4. **RAG Integration**: Used for enhanced reasoning by integrating retrieval-augmented generation capabilities.
5. **User Interface**: Developed an intuitive UI to interact with the diagnostic models.

## Future Work
- Further fine-tuning LLMs for better diagnostic accuracy
- Real-time ECG signal processing
- Integration with hospital systems for real-world use
- Continuous learning with new ECG datasets
